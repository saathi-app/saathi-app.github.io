            <h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally
                Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and
                information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify,
                contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy
                policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your
                Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

            <h3>What personal information do we collect from the people who our app?</h3>
            <p>When registering on our app, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email
                address or other details to help you with your experience.</p>

            <h3>When do we collect information?</h3>
            <p>We collect information from you when you register on our app,
                or enter information on our app.</p>

            <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
            <p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register in our app Saathi.</p>

            <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>
            <p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number
                of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
                confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket
                Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
            <p>We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses
                their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
           

            <h3>Deleting your information</h3>
            <p>If you wish to have the Personal Information that you have provided to us deleted, you can always do so
                by sending a request to us on the e-mail id  <span> <a href="mailto:tech.saathiapp@gmail.com">tech.saathiapp@gmail.com</a></span>. You may note
                that deletion of certain personal information may lead to cancellation of your registration with the
                website and your access to certain features of the website.</p>

            <h3>Do we use 'cookies'?</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Third-party disclosure</h3>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.
            </p>

            <h3>Third-party links</h3>
            <p>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.</p>

            <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
            <p>CalOPPA requires commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
                stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
                the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
                consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
                collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>

            <h3>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
            <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.<br>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on
                our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.<br>Our Privacy
                Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
            <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.<br>You can change your
                personal information by emailing us at<span> <a href="mailto:tech.saathiapp@gmail.com">tech.saathiapp@gmail.com</a></span></p>

            <h3>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>
            <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track
                (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

            <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
                Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
                United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
                websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
            <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

            <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
                concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around
                the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
                critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

            <h3>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                should a data breach occur:</h3>
            <p>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</p>
            <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
                This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.</p>

            <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>
            <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
                commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and
                spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

            <h3>We collect your email address in order to:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
                <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
                <li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
                <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
                <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
                <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
                <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
                <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by mailing us at <span> <a href="mailto:tech.saathiapp@gmail.com">tech.saathiapp@gmail.com</a></span>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span> <a href="mailto:tech.saathiapp@gmail.com">tech.saathiapp@gmail.com</a></span>and we will promptly remove you from <strong>ALL</strong>
                correspondence.</p>
